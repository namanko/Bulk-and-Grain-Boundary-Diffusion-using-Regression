This is an assignment for my course MLL100, a course on Material Science. The problem statements are as follows:
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
$x^2$ = D*t
x - distance
t - time
D - diffusivity
Given a dataset diffData.csv with columns time, distance and Diffusion, a classification among bulk diffusion(Db) and grain boundary diffusion(Dgb)
1. Predict the Bulk Diffusivity value using linear regression
2. Predict the Grain Boundary Diffusivity value using linear regression

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
1. Using Logistic Regression classify bulk diffusion and grain boundary diffusion. Input data is distance and time, and target column is Diffusion. Report the confusion matrix and classification report.
2. Now scale or normalize the data according to Xnew = (X - mean)/std and repeat the previous technique. Report the confusion matrix and classification report.
